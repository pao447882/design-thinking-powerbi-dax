# From Architecture to Data Analytics: Dashboard Design in Power BI & DAX

## Description
Data analytics project using the **Superstore dataset** with **Power BI and DAX**.  
The project applies **design thinking, EDA, and visualization techniques** to create a user-centric dashboard for business decision making.

## Tools & Skills
- Power BI (Data Modeling, Dashboard Design)
- DAX (Measures & Calculations)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Visualization & Storytelling
- Design Thinking Approach

## Dataset
Superstore Dataset (Kaggle)  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final

## Workflow
1. Understand business context & dataset  
2. Define user persona (regional manager)  
3. Write DAX measures (Profit Margin, Avg Profit per Order, etc.)  
4. Perform EDA & generate insights  
5. Design dashboard layout (KPI Cards → Map/Line → Drill-down charts)  
6. Test & refine interactions (slicers, drill-through)  
7. Highlight business impact & actionable strategies

## Key Insights
- Discount > 20% on Furniture = negative profit  
- Florida & Tennessee = loss-making states, Virginia = best performer  
- First Class delivery = premium customers with highest profit per order  
- Q4 promotion discounts drive sales but cut profits → bundling suggested  

## Impact
The dashboard transforms raw data into a **decision-making tool** by helping managers:  
- Control discount policy  
- Replicate successful regional strategies  
- Identify high-value customer segments  
- Optimize promotions for profitability
